# indeedScraper

This basic module scrapes the web www.indeed.es to download job postings. 
It stores the job title and the employer in a table. Then, it copies 
the whole job posting in a separated file and references its name in the 
table. Finally, it stores the table in a CSV file.

You are welcome to modify it to scrape other jobs postings of any country in 
which indeed operatesÂ :-)
